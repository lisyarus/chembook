\section{What it is all about}

It was already a month of me trying to come up with a perfect introduction for this book when I decided I better do something more practical. Let's get straight to the point: what is this book about? Or, rather, what is it \textit{not} about? This is \textit{not} a

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemistry textbook
\item Quantum mechanics textbook
\item Linear algebra textbook
\item Python tutorial
\end{itemize}

But what it \textit{is}, then? Well, a sturdy mix of all the above, aimed at getting physically significant results as soon as possible, yet without sacrificing understanding. We are going to write some Python code using \href{https://numpy.org}{\texttt{numpy}} and \href{https://www.scipy.org}{\texttt{scipy}} libraries (and ocasionally \href{https://matplotlib.org}{\texttt{matplotlib}}, if you want some fancy plots \& images) and obtain energies and orbital densities for some pretty tiny chemical systems (that is, systems composed of nuclei \& electrons).

The reader is expected to have \textit{at least} a bit of knowledge on physics/chemistry, basic mathematics and Python programming language. For getting into the physics and maths involved, I recommend either reading the first few chapters of \cite{ref:atkins} or at least not skipping the \nameref{chap:var} section. For learning Python, I recommend googling some tutorials/courses/etc, for there are way too many of them to recommend anything in particular.

The following few sections briefly discuss some essential theoretical background, starting with basic mechanics. I'd especially recommend reading the \nameref{chap:var} section so that you understand what all those matrices even mean and what those solvers are actually solving. The actual coding starts at the \nameref{chap:harmonic} section.

Beware that I am by no means a scientist, a quantum chemist or even a physicist. I am barely an amateur possessing some unconventional hobbies. The methods that we are going to make use of are \textbf{not} the methods used by real quantum chemical software and, as far as I understand, are only applicable to very tiny systems (with, say, 4 or 5 electrons, while systems of practical interest can contain \textit{thousands} of them). This book only covers one-electron systems.

Finally, feel free to \href{mailto:lisyarus@gmail.com}{email me} if you have some questions, I would love to be of help.
