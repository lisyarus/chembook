\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

\section{What it is all about}
It was already a month of me trying to come up with a perfect introduction for this book when I decided I better do something more practical. Let's get straight to the point: what is this book about? Or, rather, what is it \textit{not} about? This is \textit{not} a

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemistry textbook
\item Quantum mechanics textbook
\item Linear algebra textbook
\item Python tutorial
\end{itemize}

But what it \textit{is}, then? Well, a sturdy mix of all the above, aimed at getting physically significant results as soon as possible. We are going to write some Python code using \href{https://numpy.org}{\texttt{numpy}} and \href{https://www.scipy.org}{\texttt{scipy}} libraries (and ocasionally \href{https://matplotlib.org}{\texttt{matplotlib}}, if you want some fancy plots \& images) and obtain energies and orbital densities for some pretty tiny chemical systems (that is, systems composed of nuclei \& electrons).

The reader is expected to have \textit{at least} a bit of knowledge on physics/chemistry, basic mathematics and Python programming language. For getting into the physics and maths involved, I recommend either reading the first few chapters of \cite{ref:atkins} or not skipping the \nameref{chap:intro} chapter. For learning Python, I recommend googling some tutorials/courses/etc, for there are way too many of them to recommend anything in particular.

The following sections of the \nameref{chap:intro}  chapter briefly discuss some essential theoretical background. I'd especially recommend reading the \nameref{sec:var} section so that you understand what all those matrices even mean and what those solvers are actually solving. The actual coding starts at the \nameref{chap:one} chapter.

Beware that I am by no means a scientist, a quantum chemist or even a physicist. I am barely an amateur possessing some unconventional hobbies. The methods that we are going to make use of are \textbf{not} the methods used by real quantum chemical software and are applicable to tiny systems only (with, say, 4 or 5 electrons, while systems of practical interest can contain \textit{thousands} of them).

The name of this book was inspired by Peter Shirley's \href{https://raytracing.github.io}{Ray Tracing in One Weekend series}, which is an amazing source for learning about modern photorealistic rendering.

Finally, feel free to \href{mailto:lisyarus@gmail.com}{email me} if you have some questions, I would love to be of help.
